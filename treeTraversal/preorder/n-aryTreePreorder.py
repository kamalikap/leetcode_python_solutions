589. N-ary Tree Preorder Traversal
https://leetcode.com/problems/n-ary-tree-preorder-traversal/

Given an n-ary tree, return the preorder traversal of its nodes' values.
Nary-Tree input serialization is represented in their level order traversal, each group of children is separated by the null value (See examples).

Follow up:
Recursive solution is trivial, could you do it iteratively?

Example 1:
Input: root = [1,null,3,2,4,null,5,6]
Output: [1,3,5,6,2,4]

Example 2:
Input: root = [1,null,2,3,4,5,null,null,6,7,null,8,null,9,10,null,null,11,null,12,null,13,null,null,14]
Output: [1,2,3,6,7,11,14,4,8,12,5,9,13,10]
